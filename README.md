StoryGen
=================

This is a project that I've been working on, on and off, for the last four years or so. My goal is to create a fully functional story generator that can create epub files, along with ebook covers, for 5,000+ word stories that are unique enough to pass Amazon's duplicity checker.

The last iteration I made of this project relied on R, OCaml, Perl, and ImageMagick, and was only run on my Mac. My hope is that I can make this project completely in Node, and maybe someday add a user interface where folks can craft their own stories. 

I'm hosting the project on Glitch (read more below), and I'll push occasional updates to the GitHub repository.
