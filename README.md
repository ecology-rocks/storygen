StoryGen
=================

This is a project that I've been working on, on and off, for the last four years or so. My goal is to create a fully functional story generator that can create epub files, along with ebook covers, for 5,000+ word stories that are unique enough to pass Amazon's duplicity checker.

The last iteration I made of this project relied on R, OCaml, Perl, and ImageMagick, and was only run on my Mac. My hope is that I can make this project completely in Node, and maybe someday add a user interface where folks can craft their own stories. 

I'm hosting the project on Glitch (read more below), and I'll push occasional updates to the GitHub repository. 

The live version can be found [here](https://gem-cook.glitch.me/).

## Road Map and Random Notes
*  Noticed a potential issue with pronouns and past-tense was/were -- will need to watch as I implement.
*  Should add in NODEPUB and/or TURNDOWN integration to convert HTML to either markdown or an epub. 
*  Still need to do a real image generation
* Add in alternate paragraphs or storylines (v2 onwards)

### Chapter One

* Could do a relations look up to change "momma" in chapter one to various relatives or names.
* Could improve the titles by adding some randomness and using capitalizeAll or w/e it's called.
  
1. ~~Write the first version of text~~
2. ~~Import the first version and get it running~~
3. ~~Add two alternate sentence versions to each sentence~~
4. ~~Add in word variation~~

  
### Chapter Two

*  Base text is drafted, but there are a few places where branching decisions could occur.

  
1. ~~Write the first version of text~~
2. ~~Import the first version and get it running~~
3. ~~Add two alternate sentence versions to each sentence~~
4. Add in word variation (12.5 of 35 paragraphs)

### Chapter Three

*  Base text is drafted and relatively straight forward.

1. ~~Write the first version of text~~
2. ~~Import the first version and get it running~~
3. ~~Add two alternate sentence versions to each sentence~~
4. Add in word variation (0 of 21)

### Chapter Four version A

*  Base text is drafted, but this is the chapter that needs several different versions.

1. ~~Write the first version of text~~
2. ~~Import the first version and get it running~~
3. Add two alternate sentence versions to each sentence (7 of 12)
4. Add in word variation 


### Chapter Four version B

*  Base text is drafted, but this is the chapter that needs several different versions.

1. ~~Write the first version of text~~
2. ~~Import the first version and get it running~~
3. ~~Add two alternate sentence versions to each sentence~~
4. Add in word variation  (0 of 17)
