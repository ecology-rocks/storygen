StoryGen
=================

This is a project that I've been working on, on and off, for the last four years or so. My goal is to create a fully functional story generator that can create epub files, along with ebook covers, for 5,000+ word stories that are unique enough to pass Amazon's duplicity checker.

The last iteration I made of this project relied on R, OCaml, Perl, and ImageMagick, and was only run on my Mac. My hope is that I can make this project completely in Node, and maybe someday add a user interface where folks can craft their own stories. 

I'm hosting the project on Glitch (read more below), and I'll push occasional updates to the GitHub repository. 

The live version can be found [here](https://gem-cook.glitch.me/).
